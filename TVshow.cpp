//Task 2:
//Goal: Create a class for TV show
//  a- add an attribute, 2D array to hold seasons and episodes
//  b- define play to ask the user which season, then show and print out the value from that season,
//    this should print out the value from the 2d array
//  c- non-virtual function "details" should be defined as printing out the two attributes of "1a and 2a"

#include "Show.h"
#include "TVshow.h"
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

//                             };
